- implement in the CLI the ability to run one decider against one machine
- evaluate one machine and see its space time representation
- evaluate one machine and listen to it (see its transcript)
- macro machines
- let's improve z-function
- use grind whenever possible (simplify the system)
- use blue print as a ROADMAP
- use database to store how each machine can be proved, to efficiently verify them, the pipeline will find the most efficient verifier, then we store the evindence in a database and on later execution we use the evidence alone
